2,"hscrp_data","C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute phase protein synthesized in the liver. It is involved in the activation of complement, enhancement of phagocytosis, and detoxification of substances released from damaged tissue. It is one of the most sensitive, though nonspecific, indicators of inflammation. CRP levels may rise within six hours of an inflammatory stimulus. Measurement of CRP concentrations by this highly sensitive method is performed primarily to ascertain the level of cardiovascular disease risk in individuals who have no existing inflammatory conditions. Increases in CRP concentration are non-specific and should be used in conjunction with traditional clinical laboratory evaluation of acute coronary syndromes.","High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (HSCRP_L)","Nhanes"
